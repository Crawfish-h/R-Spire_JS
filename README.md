# R-Spire_JS
In this program, the player can randomly generate rooms by walking into doors and is able to fight enemies that are also randomly generated in that room.
The server used to run this program was the extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey which is available on Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

Use the keys "WASD" to move around, use the 1, 2, and 3 keys to select attack types, press space to attack once in a battle, and press enter to leave a battle.
